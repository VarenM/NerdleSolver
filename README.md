run the program using java (download java)

open up solver.java and change line 65 (under the comment) to your file location of the eqs.txt file (use same syntax as example provided)

place the three files (two java and one txt) in a folder and within a bash terminal, navigate to the folder and type: javac nerdlesolver.java (for compilation)

then type: java nerdlesolver (to run program)

then you will be prompted to type 1 or 2 for mode (either way works as of this edit)

then make a guess on the nerdle game website so you can see what greens and purples (yellows) you have (i suggest using: 9 * 8 - 7 = 65)

then when it asks you to input the greens (say 9, *, and = were all greens when we submitted our guess) input the greens respectively (like so: 9 * $ $ $ = $ $)

now keep looping thru and thats it!
