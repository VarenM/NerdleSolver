run the program using java (download java)

place the two files in a folder and within a bash terminal, navigate to the folder and type: javac nerdlesolver.java (for compilation)

then type: java nerdlesolver (to run program)

then you will be prompted to type 1 or 2 for mode (either way works as of this edit)

then make a guess on the nerdle game website so you can see what greens and purples (yellows) you have (i suggest using: 9 * 8 - 7 = 65)

then when it asks you to input the greens (say 9, *, and = were all greens when we submitted our guess) input the greens respectively (like so: 9 * $ $ $ = $ $)

now keep looping thru and thats it!
